# Predicitng the electricity-used-for-space-conditioning-in-the-New-England-region

The goal of this project was to develop statistical models that could explain relationship between electricity consumption of the commercial buildings and space conditioning parameters like Heating, Cooling and Water Heating of the New England region. 


# Data  Sources:
The dataset has been downloaded from the website of United States Energy Information Admininstration. The Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey(CBECS) dataset of the year 2012 has been taken into account and the Electricity consumption of the New England region has been predicted based on various Space Conditioning Parameters like Heating, Cooling and Water Heating.
