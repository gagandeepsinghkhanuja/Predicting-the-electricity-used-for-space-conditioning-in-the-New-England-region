# Predicitng the electricity-used-for-space-conditioning-in-the-New-England-region

There were three projects in the Energy sector I worked on, during Spring 2018 under the guidance of Professor Roshanak (Roshi) Nateghi. This project was a part of the course Predictive Modeling that I had taken during Spring 2018. I independently worked on this dataset and I have shared the detailed results, implemtation and predictions in the document along with the codes. 

The goal of this project was to develop statistical models that could explain relationship between electricity consumption of the commercial buildings and space conditioning parameters like Heating, Cooling and Water Heating of the New England region. 

The dataset was huge in terms of attributes. Exploratory Data Analysis was done keeping descriptive statistics in mind to find out the right kind of attributes needed for the analysis.

# Data  Sources:
The dataset has been downloaded from the website of United States Energy Information Admininstration. The Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey(CBECS) dataset of the year 2012 has been taken into account and the Electricity consumption of the New England region has been predicted based on various Space Conditioning Parameters like Heating, Cooling and Water Heating.
